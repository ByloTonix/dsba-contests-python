- **Contest 2:**
    - Task #11: No conditionals or loops
    - Task #13: No conditionals or loops
    - Task #17: No loops, no `.count()`
- **Contest 3:**
    - Task #10: Do not modify the initial list
    - Task #11: Must modify the initial list
    - Task #15: Modify the initial list, no additional lists
    - Task #16: Modify the initial list, no additional lists, no `.insert()`
    - Task #20: Only one pass through the list
- **Contest 4:**
    - Ensure function names, parameters, and return types match problem statements
    - Task #9, #10: Complexity O(âˆšn)
    - Task #12: Only use `+1` and `-1`, no loops
    - Task #13: Complexity O(log(n))
    - Task #18, #19: Do not use lists or strings
- **Contest 5:** No special requirements
- **Contest 6:**
    - Task #1: Do not modify the initial list, no additional lists, one pass through the list only
    - Task #3, #4: Complexity O(n)
    - Task #5: Implement `count_sort(A)` modifying the list; no built-in sorting functions

### Defences

You may be asked to defend your homework solutions. During the defence, you may:
- Explain your solution
- Modify your code based on new conditions
- Solve a similar problem on paper or in an IDE
- Identify your solution among others

Failure to attend will result in 0 points for that contest.
